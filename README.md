# Dhruvi Patel - Portfolio

## Project Description
The project at hand involved creating a portfolio website from a design that was originally made in UX I class using **Adobe XD**. The goal was to bring this design to life through web development. As it was the first portfolio website that I have ever developed, I started with thorough research and analysis to identify the target audience for my website. I kept in mind the general preferences of users to ensure the website would be appealing to them. While designing the website, I aimed to strike a balance between simplicity and engagement. I wanted the website to appear playful and fun to the modern audience while remaining accessible to millennials. 

The website features a work page that includes detailed descriptions of two of my previous design works that are related to my current style and genre. I have implemented all of my preferred styles in my projects and designs and this is reflected in the content display of the website. I have strived to create a website that is inviting to users and encourages them to explore my work and discover my passion for designing. All in all, it is a platform that showcases my skills and expertise in the design field.


## Challenges 
During the course of working on my project, I encountered several hurdles along the way. One of the biggest challenges I faced was making it responsive, as this required a great deal of attention to detail and careful planning. In addition, developing the prototype and High-Fidelity proved to be quite demanding, as I had to ensure that all the sections were properly coded for web development. 

Despite my best efforts, I struggled with certain areas of Bootstrap, and felt that I needed to devote more time and practice to master it. To further challenge myself, I decided to incorporate a header video in the first impression of my website, which was something I had never attempted before. Unfortunately, I encountered some issues with overlapping elements, which made me feel somewhat uncertain and underconfident. Nevertheless, I persevered and did my best to fix the problems as much as possible.

### Lessons Learned
The project was an excellent opportunity for me to learn and grow. I am proud of myself for doing a great job on my first attempt. However, I am aware that I still have much to learn and improve upon. Even though I dedicated a significant amount of time to learning Bootstrap, I still felt that I could benefit from more practice. In particular, I want to focus on honing my skills in creating responsive and mobile-friendly websites, as these are crucial aspects of web development in today's industry. As a developer, it is essential to be able to design websites that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices, so I am committed to improving my skills in this area.
